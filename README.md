# toinstall
This are my personal dot files. 

You can install all automatically. You just need fist of to be connected to internet. 
I'm trying to make it modular as possible. 
You can check packages.txt to see what packages are installed to your system and eventually append what you need.

This is still WIP so please be patient.
